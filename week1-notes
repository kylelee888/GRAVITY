Chris' presentation:

-- delete objects that escape to cut down on computational work
-- position after merger post-collision
-- input: print to stderr so not gobbled up by anim etc.
-- initial conditions: random part plus spin part
-- much easier way to do initial condition
-- collisions: simpler way to modify length of list
-- collisions: put new planet at COM
-- COM correction: only do that once (but ejected particles)
