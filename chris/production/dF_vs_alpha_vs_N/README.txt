I do not understand what we are showing people with this. If we hold max level constant,
and plot dF vs alpha for different N, we are showing how the error varies with number of
particles. Did not we want to show that higher levels/ dynamicly making boxes is necessary
for to continue to improve our algorithm? We want to show that at a certain level, we no
longer gain anything. Is this not what we wanted to show???
